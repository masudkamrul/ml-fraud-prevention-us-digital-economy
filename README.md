# Machine Learning–Driven Fraud Prevention for the U.S. Digital Economy

This repository contains research prototypes and experimental code for an
**AI/ML-based fraud detection framework** designed to protect the **U.S. digital economy**
across three major vectors:

1. **Online shopping fraud** (fake stores, non-delivery scams, social media scams)
2. **Phishing-enabled fraud** (malicious URLs, credential theft, account takeover)
3. **Digital payment fraud** (fraudulent transactions, unauthorized payments, chargebacks)

The goal is to develop **scalable machine learning models** and simple prototype applications
that demonstrate real-time fraud risk scoring for online transactions.

> ⚠️ All data in this repository are **synthetic** or **anonymized** and are used only for
> research and demonstration purposes.

## 🔹 Project Objectives

- Build a **modular ML pipeline** for fraud detection workflows
- Create **risk-scoring models** for online transactions and URLs
- Develop a **prototype dashboard** for demonstrating real-time fraud alerts
- Provide results that support:
  - Academic research collaborations
  - U.S. industry pilot testing
  - Future government funding proposals

This project directly supports **U.S. consumer protection, cybersecurity,
and secure digital financial systems**, which have been recognized as national
priorities by the FTC, DHS, and NSTC.
